		<p>Petscop 2 is Pyrocynical's lost video. Pyro has stated a couple of times that he was working on it but no Petscop 2 was uploaded.</p>
		
		<p>If you don't know what Petscop is, here's a quick rundown, Petscop is a fake game that was uploaded to the Youtube channel of the 
		same name. In the 1st video, it was all happy and calm, everything takes a turn for the worst at the end of it.</p>
		
		<p>Here's Pyro's original Petscop video and Petscop has very dark themes, don't watch it if you are very sensitive.</p>
